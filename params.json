Web Store url is https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lnfepbjehgokldcaljagbmchhnaaogpc.   Give it a try!\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n[KeePass](http://keepass.info/) password files work well for me on Windows, but on my Chromebook there were no good options to access them.  \r\n\r\nChrome recently implemented the [Web Crypto API](http://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/), so it became practical to write JavaScript code that could parse a KeePass file.  I decided to utilize those to create the extension that I wished existed - one that lets me control my own passwords in a secure format, is simple to use, and does not require any special permissions (i.e. **no** \"Access your browse data on all sites\").\r\n\r\n## Major Features\r\n* Zero permissions required to install\r\n* Works with KeePass v1 (.kdb) and v2 (.kdbx) files, with any combination of key file and master password\r\n* Retrieves KeePass password file from Google Drive, or static copies can be stored in Chrome storage\r\n* Smart matching of password entry to website, so that you don't have to manually search for your entry\r\n* Manual searching of entries, for those wierd edge cases\r\n* Fills in password on website, no need to copy-paste!  (But if you prefer not to grant permission, you can still use copy-paste)\r\n* Anti-phishing detection - warns if the site is not the one that ChromeKeePass remembers\r\n* Passwords are always encrypted in memory (except briefly when you actually use them!)\r\n\r\n## Additional features\r\n* Easily switch between multiple password database files\r\n* Automatic unlock of key-only databases\r\n\r\n## Known Limitations\r\nFile browse dialog may cause the popup to close on some OS's.  It is confirmed to do that on Xubuntu and on some Windows machines.  It works 100% on ChromeOS, and works ok on Mac.  \r\n\r\nThe extension does not work in incognito mode.\r\n\r\nThe extension icon activates on pages with iframes, even when there are no password fields.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
