  ChromeKeePass is an extension that uses your existing KeePass database files to autofill passwords on websites.
  <br>
  <br> The extension is only visible when you go to a web page that requests a password. When it activates, it shows a small KeePass icon on the right hand side of the browser address bar. Clicking on the icon will give you options to connect to your KeePass
  database, unlock it, and then autofill in the password on the website.
  <br><br>
  Try it out on this sample login page: <a href="http://keepass.info/help/kb/testform.html" target="_blank">http://keepass.info/help/kb/testform.html</a>
